# tic-tac-toe
This repository contains a tic-tac-toe game project made using REACT framework. <br>
This is the first REACT app project made by me. <br>
This project was created by refrencing the REACT tutorial from REACT documantation.

<h2>How to run this project?</h2>
steps:<br>
on your local computer:<br>
  1] have node js and create-react-app installed (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-react-with-create-react-app/  --refer this if you dont know how)<br>
  2] clone this project <br>
  3] from the directory of the project run "npm start" in the terminal and the react app will start.<br>
on a code sandbox:<br>
  1] open any code sandbox that renders react code. (like this one:  https://codesandbox.io/?from-app=1).<br>
  2] create necessary files as in this project and copy paste the code.
